                                                  COVID DATA ANALYSIS


As of mid-May 2021, the latest outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes acute severe
respiratory syndrome (SARS), has killed over 38 million people and infected over 178 million people around the world. During this time, there have been over 1.8 million recoveries. It is essential for the government to be aware of the situation and to be able to forecast potential patient numbers to ensure healthcare readiness and prepare for other appropriate steps.
Using this as a driving force, we are trying analyze and visualize the data of covid 19 and  build a model for predicting the number of future COVID–19 cases using Hadoop, which will then be used to forecast potential events.

PROJECT SCOPE:


The project aims to analyze the data trends of COVID-19 cases globally and present the overall data report of confirmed, recovered and death cases around the world.

•  The main objective of this project is to focus on the total number of people affected by covid-19 in each country.

•  We will analyze how many people got affected by covid-19 versus the total number of people who recovered from covid-19.
